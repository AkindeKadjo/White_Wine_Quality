## Introduction and Goals

The goal of the project is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests

## Data Info
The provided datasets is that of the white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. [Data Source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)


## Methods Used
The languague used fo this Project is Python in a Collaboratory environement.

Data cleaning protocol consisted of checking for duplicate (then removing them), checking for the presence of missing data, and fixing inconsistent data by removing significant outliers.
Scikit libraries were used for machine learning, such as Preprocessor. Predictions were done with both linear regression model and an optimized Random forest model.

## Conclusion
Overall, with an accuracy of 56% we were able to predict white wine quality metrics from their physicochemical tests. Although the data received was from the white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal, it would be interesting to see how our predictions fares against other wine samples or if we would get an entirely different prediction from a much larger sample size.
